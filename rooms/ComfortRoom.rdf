Comfort Room

You are inside the damp comfort room and it feeling how many more people got in there before you did.
End

Desc
You find a used soap lying on rack together with a seemingly empty bottle of shampoo. A clump of hair seems have clogged the drain. Even the toilet is left unflushed by this room's previous users.
