Intro
Everyone is walking dryly around the campus looking like zombies. The side-effect of quality education seems to be getting to them.
End

Desc
You try not to notice everyone staring into nothingness as they try to study as you stumble upon a really thick book. No one seems to own the book. On the other hand, you heard a subtle amount of pandemonium from the university's sports complex.
